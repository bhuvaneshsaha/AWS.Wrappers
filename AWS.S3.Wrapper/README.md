> The library contains both synchronous and asynchronousÂ methods.
>> For the asynchronous methods, you can replace the method names with the Async version and use await before calling them.

<p>Amazon S3 does not have a native concept of folders or directories like a traditional file system. However, we create a pseudo-directory structure using prefixes and delimiters in object keys. This approach is commonly used to organize objects within a bucket.

Here are some methods you can add to your S3Wrapper to handle path/directory related operations:

**CreateDirectory**: Create an empty "directory" by uploading an object with a zero-byte size and a key that ends with a delimiter (usually /).

**ListDirectories**: List "directories" within a bucket or a "parent" directory by using the prefix and delimiter options while listing objects.

**DeleteDirectory**: Delete a "directory" by deleting all objects with the specified prefix.
